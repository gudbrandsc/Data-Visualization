        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>During my beta feedback sessions, I received a lot of positive feedback for both of my visualizations, and how they were going to work together to achieve my goal.
            Included in the table below are the rubric feedback I got from my peers, where I did not receive a full score.

        <p>One of the first issues I encountered with my beta release was the confusion about the ratio, as the word itself does not provide a lot of meaning.
            It, therefore, became very important for me to make sure that I gave a clear explanation of what the ratio represented so that the visualizations
            would not be interpreted incorrectly.  I, therefore, made sure to explain what the ratio represented in both my visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>I also received some feedback that the colors in the multi-line chart were not complimenting, the colors of the choropleth map.
            Since the map only used different shades of red, it became difficult to find any color scheme that would complement the map without making it
            difficult to differentiate the colors from the color legend to the correlating line. I, therefore, decided to go for colors that helped the
            user differentiate between the lines rather than complimenting the map.
        </p>
        <p>There was also so confused about the California average line, and why that line was shown when showing the different crime types.
            To solve this I tried to add 4 lines, each representing the average California crime rate for a specific crime type.
            I did, however, feel that this just created a lot of noise in my visualization, and just made it more difficult to analyze.
            I, therefore, decided to keep it as it is, and rather provide some more detail about what the California average represented.
        </p>
        <p>The last comment that I received suggested using a stacked bar chart, instead of a multi-line char.
            I did however not use this because I felt that a line chart would represent time series data in a more understandable way than a stacked bar chart.
